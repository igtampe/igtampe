![Welcome Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igtampe/igtampe/master/GithubBanner4.png)

My name is Ignacio Tampe (He/Him), and I'm an aspring software engineer from the little island of Puerto Rico. I've got quite a few projects here, coded in VB.NET, ASP.NET, Java, and C#. Even though I only recently started working with C#, it has quickly grown to become one of my favorite languages. I hope to code a lot more on it in the future!

Most of my works are licensed under CC0, so if you see something you could use amongst my code, don't hesitate to grab it! I'd appreciate a little note to tell me that you've used it, but you don't need to do that.

I'm eager to help, and am always looking for a new challenge! If you've got something for me, don't hesitate to send me an email.
