## Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Ignacio Tampe (He/Him), and I'm an aspring software engineer from the little island of Puerto Rico. I've got quite a few projects here, coded in VB.NET, ASP.NET, Java, and most recently C#. I'm currently working on learning that last one, and I'm really enjoying it.

Most of my works are licensed under CC0, so if you see something you could use amongst my code, don't hesitate to grab it! I'd appreciate a little note to tell me that you've used it, but you don't need to do that.

I'm eager to help, and am always looking for a new challenge! If you've got something for me, don't hesitate to send me an email.
