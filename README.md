![Welcome Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igtampe/igtampe/master/GithubBanner5.png)

My name is Ignacio Tampe (He/Him), and I'm an aspring software engineer from the little island of Puerto Rico. I've got quite a few projects here, coded in C#, ReactJS, VB.NET, ASP.NET, and Java. I've come a long way since I started working on small little batch files, and I have a long way to go still in my learning journeys with C# and ReactJS. I'm very excited to keep learning more about these languages, technologies, and more in my path to become a better software engineer!

----

I've got several projects varying wildly in subject, and most of my works are licensed under CC0. If you see something you could use amongst my code, don't hesitate to grab it! I'd appreciate a little note to tell me that you've used it, but you don't need to do that.

I'm eager to help, and am always looking for a new challenge! If you've got something for me, don't hesitate to send me an email.
